### Generating Reports in Cypress Using Cucumber Reporting

Reporting
Cucumber plugin for Cypress comes with a variety of options for setting up reporters. Iâ€™m goint to show you the simplest one - HTML reporter.

Pretty much all you need to do is to set up your configuration:

```json
{
  "html": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```
By default report gets generated at project folder level. To override default behavior we have to use

```json
{
  "html": {
    "enabled": true,
    "output": "cypress/reports/cucumber-report/cucumber-report.html"
  }
}
```

`npm install rimraf --save-dev`
